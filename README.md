# TourMate
CS3217 Team Project

## Getting Started

To run this app, clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Vielheim/TourMate

```

Move into the project directory:

```bash

cd TourMate

```


Run the following command to setup the project. 

```bash

sudo gem install cocoapods
pod install

```

**Note:**
If you are on Macbook M1, you might face some issues using Cocoapods. Visit this [link](https://medium.com/codex/simple-way-to-use-cocoapods-on-m1-ac9e22cf7e1c) to resolve any issues.

Finally, open the `TourMate.xcworkspace` file to open the project on XCode. You will need to change the development team and bundle identifier accordingly to be able to build it locally.
